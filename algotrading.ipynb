In this tutorial, we will use the Random Forest algorithim to build a classification model that will help us predict whether a stock will close up or down based on range of technical indicators.\n\n## What is Random Forest?\nNow, up above I gave you a pretty simple definition of what Random Forest is. However, I think it's important to delve in more detail about it before we start coding our model. Now in short, Random Forests is a supervised machine learning algorithim that uses multiple decision trees in aggregate to help make more stable and accurate predictions.\n\nAfter reading that you're probably going, \"Well you answered one question but left me with a few more.\" Let's go over some of those questions.\n\n### What are Decision Trees?\nDecision Trees are the fundamental building blocks of Random Forest. In essence, Decision Trees is flowlike chart structure where each node of the tree is used to test a particular attribute of the object. For example, imagine I have a person which will represent our object. We then test certain attributes of this person object. For example, one test would be whether they are male or female. The test will represent a \"Decision Node\" in our tree, and each of the possible outcomes \"Male\" or \"Female\" will represent a leaf node.The first \"Decision Node\" in our Decision Tree will be our \"Root Node\"\n\n- **Root Node:** Represents entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets. Our starting point.\n- **Splitting:** The process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes, for example we split on gender.\n- **Decision Node:** When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called decision node.\n- **Leaf/Terminal Node:** Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node.\n- **Pruning:** When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say opposite process of splitting.\n- **Branch/Sub-Tree:** A sub section of entire tree is called branch or sub-tree.\n- **Parent and Child Node:** A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called parent node of sub-nodes whereas sub-nodes are the child of parent node.\n\n### What is Ensemble Learning?\nAn Ensemble Learning model is a model in which decisions are used from MULTIPLE MODELS to improve the overall performance of the model. The old idea that 2 minds are better than 1, prefectly summarizes ensemble learning. We use the results of multiple models to get a better idea of what the true answer is. Our Random Forest algorithim uses Bagging to help improve performance.\n\n### Why use Random Forest?\nNow, when you read the definition about decision trees you may be thinking, \"That sounds like a really simple and intuitive model. Why would we not just use decision trees?\". Well, it boils down to the following few points:\n\n1. Instability: Even small changes to the input data can have dramatic changes to the overall strucutre of the decision tree.\n2. They are often relatively inaccurate. Many other predictors perform better with similar data.\n3. For data including categorical variables with different number of levels, information gain in decision trees is biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.\n4. Calculations can get very complex, particularly if many values are uncertain and/or if many outcomes are linked.\n\nThese are some of the reasons it's preferable to use Random Forest because we will see that it helps overcome some of the weaknesses of Decision Trees. Now, as with anything, there is no perfect model. Just because something has weaknesses means it's worthless it just means we have to understand those weaknesses and keep eye out for them as we use them.\n\n### What is Supervised Learning?\nIn machine learning, we have two categories of learning. Supervised learning and unsupervised learning. With unsupervised learning, we don't supervise the model and instead allow it to discover information on it's own. We do this by providing an \"UNLABELED\" data set that doesn't tell the model what category or value is the \"correct\" answer.\n\nWith supervised learning, we provide the model with a \"LABELED\" data set which tells the model what the \"correct\" value it should be. Random Forest, is an example of a supervised learning algorithim because we provide the model a labeled data set.","metadata":{"id":"6VEYRRw5wBji"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import libraries\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport requests\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import plot_roc_curve\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n!pip install config\n\nfrom config import ACCOUNT_NUMBER, ACCOUNT_PASSWORD, CONSUMER_ID, REDIRECT_URI","metadata":{"id":"q6uaI7LDwBjm","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-13T16:48:46.985476Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-13T16:48:46.985808Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-13T16:48:56.581254Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-13T16:48:46.985781Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-13T16:48:56.578973Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Preprocessing: Loading the TD API Library\n\nFor those of you who watched my series on building a Python API Client library for TD Ameritrade, here is a chance to put that library to use.

For example, they make predictions 30 days out, 60 days out and 90 days out. To make this type of prediction, we have to transform the data so that when we pass it through the model it will be able to make those predictions that far out.

This condition is generally interpreted as a sign that the stock is overvalued, and the price is likely to go down. A stock is said to be oversold when the price goes down sharply to a level below its true value. This is a result caused due to panic selling. RSI ranges from 0 to 100, and generally, when RSI is above 70, it may indicate that the stock is overbought and when RSI is below 30, it may indicate the stock is oversold.\n\n**Formula**:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\ RSI = 100 - \\frac{100}{1+RS}\n\\end{align}\n\n**Code:**\n\nFrom this point forward, a lot of the calculations will be mostly the same but only differ on the type of calculation we do.

However, we are missing one critical piece of information that is crucial to the model, the column we wish to predict. Now at this point, our data frame doesn't have that column, but we will create it before we feed the data into the model.\n\nHowever, before we create it, I want to take some time and understand the exact problem we are trying to solve. Our goal is to predict whether the next day is either a `down_day` or an `up_day`. Based on this knowledge, we are solving a classification problem. If you don't remember, there are two categories of problems in machine learning, classification, and regression. With classification problems, we try to predict which group new values belong to. For example, based on store sales, are they `outperforming store` or an `underperforming store`. Classification problems are problems that have discrete groups. With regression problems, we are trying to predict non-discrete values and, for example, trying to forecast future sales based on previous sales.\n\nIn our case, we have a classification problem because we have two discrete groups, `up_days` and `down_days`, and our goal is to take new values (new prices) and classify them into these two groups based on their values.\n\nTo create our prediction column, we will group our data frame by each `symbol`. After we've created our groups, we need to select the `close` column as this contains the price we need to determine if the stock closed up or down for any given day. Now, we can use a similar logic we used to calculate the price change. However, in this case, we only need to know if the price is higher or lower compared to the previous day.\n\nTake your groups, use the `transform` method to apply a lambda function to your groups. The lambda function will use the `diff()` function to compare the current price to the previouse price. We then wrap the results of that function in the `numpy.sign()` function. That function will return `1.0` for negative values (down days), `1.0` for postive values, and `0.0` for no change (flat days).","metadata":{"id":"qgrMbyMMwBj1"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a column we wish to predict\n'''\n    In this case, let's create an output column that will be 1 if the closing price at time 't' is greater than 't-1' and 0 otherwise.\n    In other words, if the today's closing price is greater than yesterday's closing price it would be 1.\n'''\n\n# Group by the `Symbol` column, then grab the `Close` column.\nclose_groups = price_data.groupby('symbol')['close']\n\n# Apply the lambda function which will return -1.0 for down, 1.0 for up and 0.0 for no change.\nclose_groups = close_groups.transform(lambda x : np.sign(x.diff()))\n\n# add the data to the main dataframe.\nprice_data['Prediction'] = close_groups\n\n# for simplicity in later sections I'm going to make a change to our prediction column.

It's difficult to compare two models with low precision and high recall or vice versa. To make results comparable, we use a metric called the F-Score. The F-score helps to measure Recall and Precision at the same time. It uses Harmonic Mean in place of Arithmetic Mean by punishing the extreme values more.","metadata":{"id":"yqjttJPjwBj3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the traget names\ntarget_names = ['Down Day', 'Up Day']\n\n# Build a classifcation report\nreport = classification_report(y_true = y_test, y_pred = y_pred, target_names = target_names, output_dict = True)\n\n# Add it to a data frame, transpose it for readability.\nreport_df = pd.DataFrame(report).transpose()\nreport_df","metadata":{"id":"Dz5OSkxpwBj4","outputId":"5a89712f-41aa-4df8-d507-1aa65ba58e5a","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.024974Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.025424Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.041855Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.025386Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.040815Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrix","metadata":{"id":"gM4cVnJSwBj4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, plot_confusion_matrix\n\nrf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\n\ntrue_negatives = rf_matrix[0][0]\nfalse_negatives = rf_matrix[1][0]\ntrue_positives = rf_matrix[1][1]\nfalse_positives = rf_matrix[0][1]\n\naccuracy = (true_negatives + true_positives) / (true_negatives + true_positives + false_negatives + false_positives)\npercision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)\nrecall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)\nspecificity = true_negatives / (true_negatives + false_positives)\n\nprint('Accuracy: {}'.format(float(accuracy)))\nprint('Percision: {}'.format(float(percision)))\nprint('Recall: {}'.format(float(recall)))\nprint('Specificity: {}'.format(float(specificity)))\n\ndisp = plot_confusion_matrix(rand_frst_clf, X_test, y_test, display_labels = ['Down Day', 'Up Day'], normalize = 'true', cmap=plt.cm.Blues)\ndisp.ax_.set_title('Confusion Matrix - Normalized')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"id":"jsyw1eEPwBj4","outputId":"0b380b7a-cebb-4a5a-93b2-f99f3fcb0039","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.411175Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.411678Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.4327Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.411632Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.431038Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model Evaluation: Feature Importance\nWith any model, you want to have an idea of what features are helping explain most of the model, as this can give you insight as to why you're getting the results you are. With Random Forest, we can identify some of our most important features or, in other words, the features that help explain most of the model. In some cases, some of our features might not be very important, or in other words, when compared to additional features, don't explain much of the model.\n\n### Why Do We Care About Feature Importance?\nWhat that means is if we were to get rid of those features, our accuracy will go down a little, hopefully, but not significantly. You might be asking, \"Why would I want to get rid of a feature if it lowers my accuracy?\" Well, it depends, in some cases, you don't care if your model is 95% accurate or 92% accurate. To you, a 92% accurate model is just as good as a 95% accurate model.\n\nHowever, if you wanted to get a 95% accurate model, you would, in this hypothetical case, have to train your model twice as long. Now, I'm a little extreme in this case, but the idea is the same. The cost doesn't justify the benefit. In the real world, we have to make these decisions all the time, and in some cases, it just doesn't warrant the extra cost for such a minimal increase in the accuracy.\n\n### Calculating the Feature Importance\nLike all the previous steps, SkLearn makes this process very easy. Take your `rand_frst_clf` and call the `feature_importances_` property. This will return all of our features and their importance measurement. Store the values in a `Pandas.Series` object and sore the values.\n\nFeature importance can be calculated two ways in Random Forest:\n\n1. Gini-Based Importance\n2. Accuracy-Based Importance\n\nHere is how both measures of importance are calculated.\n\nWith `sklearn` they use the Gini-Importance metric for the Random Forest Algorithm.\n\nWe can see in our model, that the most important feature is `k_percent` and our least important feature is `Price_Rate_Of_Change`.","metadata":{"id":"En2ml6a8wBj5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calculate feature importance and store in pandas series\nfeature_imp = pd.Series(rand_frst_clf.feature_importances_, index=X_Cols.columns).sort_values(ascending=False)\nfeature_imp","metadata":{"id":"ifLjBWUEwBj5","outputId":"3f35c852-5bec-42e9-a19b-c542d24c592c","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.788764Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.7891Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.805048Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.789072Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-13T16:46:36.803974Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model Evaluation: Feature Importance Graphing\nIf you want, you can also graph the feature importance of our model, so it's a little easier to visualize the results.

Instead, with Random Forest, we have to try different values to find what the optimal values should be for each of the parameters. Fortunately, for us, this can be done using the `RandomizedSearchCV` method provided by `sklearn`.\n\nThe idea behind this approach is to provide a wide range of possible values for each hyperparameter and then using cross-validation, to try different combinations of these parameters. With the highest result of these combinations being the one, we should use for our data set.\n\nTo use this method, we need to first import the `RandomizedSearchCV` object from the `sklearn.model_selection` module. From there, we need to define a range of values for each of the hyperparameters we wish to test. To do this appropriately, we need to make sure we understand what each argument means in the model, so let's walk through them:\n\n1. n_estimators - The number of trees in the forest.\n2. max_features - The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n3. max_depth - The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.\n4. min_samples_split - The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n5. min_samples_leaf - The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.\n6. bootstrap - Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees.
