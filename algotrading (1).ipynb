    "the price upwards. This condition is generally interpreted as a sign that the stock is overvalued, and the price is likely to go down. A stock is said to be oversold when the price goes down sharply to a level below its true value. This is a result caused due to panic selling. RSI ranges from 0 to 100, and generally, when RSI is above 70, it may indicate that the stock is overbought and when RSI is below 30, it may indicate the stock is oversold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\ RSI = 100 - \\frac{100}{1+RS}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Copy the desired columns and store them in new variables.\n",
    "2. Group the columns by the `symbol`, select the column we wish to perform the transformation on and use the `transform` method along with a lambda function to calculate the indicator.\n",
    "3. Store the values in the main data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there might be a few extra steps in between, but the general idea is the same across each indicator. Now for the RSI indicator, I need to identify the up days and down days. Well, lucky for us, we already have the `change_in_price ` column, so we can use a condition that will set the value to 0 if the price went up for down days and vice versa for up days. After that, I need to make sure I have the absolute values for down days, or else the calculation won't be correct, so I modify that column and then calculate the EMA of both the Up and Down columns. Finally, I calculate the Relative strength metric and pass that through to the RSI calculation."

In this case, the paper never provided a specific `n,` but after doing some research, I landed on an `n` of 9 because this seemed to be the standard window.

    "\n",
    "However, before we create it, I want to take some time and understand the exact problem we are trying to solve. Our goal is to predict whether the next day is either a `down_day` or an `up_day`. Based on this knowledge, we are solving a classification problem. If you don't remember, there are two categories of problems in machine learning, classification, and regression. With classification problems, we try to predict which group new values belong to. For example, based on store sales, are they `outperforming store` or an `underperforming store`. Classification problems are problems that have discrete groups. With regression problems, we are trying to predict non-discrete values and, for example, trying to forecast future sales based on previous sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have a classification problem because we have two discrete groups, `up_days` and `down_days`, and our goal is to take new values (new prices) and classify them into these two groups based on their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create our prediction column, we will group our data frame by each `symbol`. After we've created our groups, we need to select the `close` column as this contains the price we need to determine if the stock closed up or down for any given day. Now, we can use a similar logic we used to calculate the price change. However, in this case, we only need to know if the price is higher or lower compared to the previous day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take your groups, use the `transform` method to apply a lambda function to your groups. The lambda function will use the `diff()` function to compare the current price to the previouse price. We then wrap the results of that function in the `numpy.sign()` function. That function will return `1.0` for negative values (down days), `1.0` for postive values, and `0.0` for no change (flat days)."

    "With any model, you want to have an idea of what features are helping explain most of the model, as this can give you insight as to why you're getting the results you are. With Random Forest, we can identify some of our most important features or, in other words, the features that help explain most of the model. In some cases, some of our features might not be very important, or in other words, when compared to additional features, don't explain much of the model.\n",

You might be asking, \"Why would I want to get rid of a feature if it lowers my accuracy?\" Well, it depends, in some cases, you don't care if your model is 95% accurate or 92% accurate. To you, a 92% accurate model is just as good as a 95% accurate model.\n",

What I do in the chart below is chart the cumulative importance or, in other words, how much does each feature add to the total. That way, we can see how much each feature is contributing to the overall importance. Another standard graph that is used is a bar chart."

    "The Receiver Operating Characteristic is a graphical method to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier. A curve is drawn by plotting True Positive Rate (sensitivity) against False Positive Rate (1 - specificity) at various threshold values. ROC curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. When the curve comes closer to the left-hand border and the top border of the ROC space, it indicates that the test is accurate. The closer the curve is to the top and left-hand border, the more accurate the test is. If the curve is close to the 45 degrees diagonal of the ROC space, it means that the test is not accurate. ROC curves can be used to select the optimal model and discard the suboptimal ones."

    "If you remember way up above, I mentioned that there is no magic number of estimators to use with every data set. Instead, with Random Forest, we have to try different values to find what the optimal values should be for each of the parameters. Fortunately, for us, this can be done using the `RandomizedSearchCV` method provided by `sklearn`.\n",

    "To use this method, we need to first import the `RandomizedSearchCV` object from the `sklearn.model_selection` module. From there, we need to define a range of values for each of the hyperparameters we wish to test. To do this appropriately, we need to make sure we understand what each argument means in the model, so let's walk through them:\n",

    "1. n_estimators - The number of trees in the forest.\n",

    "4. min_samples_split - The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "5. min_samples_leaf - The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.\n",
